## Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)

Frontend is the part of a web application that users directly see on their screen. It focuses on appearance and user experience.

* It is responsible for how the website looks, such as layout, colors, buttons, text, and images.
* Frontend sends requests to the backend and shows the response to the user.
* It handles user actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and submitting data.


Basically, frontend is everything the user interacts with on a website.

## Q2. Role of Backend (BE)

Backend is the part of a web application that works in the background. Users do not see it, but it performs all important tasks.

* It handles login, authentication, and security of user data.
* It processes requests received from the frontend.
* It stores and manages data in databases.


Backend acts like the control system of the application.

## Q3. Business Logic

Business Logic means the rules that decide how an application should behave. These rules are based on real-life situations and requirements.

### Examples:

1. **Online Shopping Website**
   A discount is applied only when the total amount crosses a specific value.

2. **Bank Application**
   A user cannot withdraw money if the account balance is insufficient.

3. **College Management System**
   Students are allowed to register for exams only if attendance is above the required percentage.

Business logic makes sure the system works correctly according to rules.

## Q4. Client–Server Model

The Client–Server model explains how communication happens between users and servers.

* **Client**: The client is the user side, such as a web browser or mobile app.
* **Server**: The server processes requests and sends responses.

### Communication Flow:

Client → Request → Server → Response → Client

This model helps in smooth data exchange.

## Q5. Three-Tier Architecture

Three-tier architecture divides a web application into three layers.

### Presentation Layer

* This is the frontend layer.
* It interacts directly with users.

### Application Layer

* This layer contains business logic.
* It processes requests from the frontend.

### Data Layer

* This layer stores and manages data.

### Why It Is Used

* Easy to manage and maintain.
* Better security.
* Improved scalability.

## Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language

JavaScript is also used on the backend side of web applications.

* It provides fast performance using asynchronous operations.
* It has a large ecosystem of tools and libraries.
* Popular backend frameworks include Node.js and Express.js.

Using JavaScript on both frontend and backend makes development easier.
